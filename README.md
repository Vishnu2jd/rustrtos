# Rust RTOS Component

This project implements a basic Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) component in Rust, demonstrating real-time scheduling capabilities. It's designed as a learning tool and a starting point for more complex RTOS implementations.

## Features

- Task scheduling based on priorities
- Basic timing and interrupt handling
- Simple API for creating and managing tasks


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-rtos-component.git
   cd rust-rtos-component
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command in the project root directory:

```
cargo run
```


## Testing

To run the tests:

```
cargo test
```

## Customizing the RTOS

You can customize the RTOS behavior by modifying the tasks in `src/main.rs`. Add new tasks, change priorities, or modify task behaviors to experiment with different scheduling scenarios.
